Aim:
The aim of the Evidence Management System using Blockchain is to create a decentralized, secure, and transparent platform that ensures the integrity, traceability, and accountability of evidence handling throughout its lifecycle. By leveraging blockchain technology, this system aims to eliminate tampering risks, establish an immutable chain of custody, and provide an auditable record for legal and law enforcement purposes.

Objectives:
Ensure Evidence Integrity:
Use blockchain's immutable nature to store tamper-proof records of all evidence transactions, preventing unauthorized changes or alterations.

Enhance Transparency and Traceability:
Provide a complete and verifiable chain of custody for each piece of evidence, enabling stakeholders to track evidence from collection to court submission in real-time.

Improve Accountability:
Record every action performed on the evidence (e.g., transfers, access, modifications) with time stamps and authorized user identities, creating a transparent audit trail.

Automate Workflows with Smart Contracts:
Implement smart contracts to automate evidence-related workflows, such as approval processes, evidence transfers, and access control based on predefined rules.

Facilitate Role-Based Access Control:
Define and enforce access control policies to restrict evidence access to authorized personnel, reducing the risk of unauthorized handling.

Minimize Evidence Misplacement or Loss:
Ensure that every piece of evidence is logged and tracked securely, reducing the chance of misplacement or loss within the system.

Foster Trust and Public Confidence:
Promote public confidence in the legal and judicial system by ensuring that evidence handling is transparent, traceable, and secure, reducing risks of wrongful convictions or injustice.

Introduction 

In the digital age, the integrity and management of evidence are paramount in legal and forensic investigations, where the reliability and authenticity of information can make or break a case. Digital evidence, which includes log files, text files, images, and emails, is now a cornerstone of legal proceedings, but preserving its legitimacy remains a critical challenge. Without inherent mechanisms to prove its authenticity, digital evidence is vulnerable to tampering or modification, raising serious concerns about its admissibility in court. Traditional methods of ensuring evidence integrity, such as hash functions, are insufficient on their own, as they only prove that a file hasn’t been modified since the hash was calculated. The Digital Forensic Life Cycle further highlights the importance of documenting every interaction with evidence to ensure findings are repeatable and verifiable.
A key element of this process is the Chain of Custody (CoC)—a record that tracks every interaction and change made to the evidence throughout an investigation. Maintaining the integrity of this log is essential, as any alteration can jeopardize the investigation and compromise the admissibility of the evidence. Traditionally, monitoring CoC has been paper-based, but this method is prone to errors, inefficiency, and tampering, especially when dealing with digital data that is easier to modify remotely with minimal traceability.
The digitalization of forensic evidence management has emerged as a potential solution, addressing many of the challenges posed by traditional approaches. However, it introduces its own set of difficulties, particularly in ensuring that the CoC itself is secure, immutable, and free from unauthorized modifications. Given the dynamic nature of digital evidence handling, a novel approach to safeguarding the integrity of the CoC is required.
Blockchain technology has emerged as a promising solution to these issues. Blockchain’s decentralized, tamper-resistant ledger can maintain the integrity of the CoC through digitally signed transactions grouped into blocks, which are linked via cryptographic hashes. Any unauthorized changes to the evidence or CoC are immediately detectable, as they invalidate the entire chain. Existing research has explored blockchain’s application in ensuring CoC immutability, but challenges remain, particularly around the lack of built-in access control mechanisms and integration with other tools used in digital investigations.
This paper aims to explore how blockchain can revolutionize evidence management by providing a secure, transparent, and verifiable method of tracking digital evidence while overcoming the limitations of current methods. By integrating more sophisticated access control mechanisms and modular storage engines, blockchain can offer a robust framework for maintaining the integrity of digital evidence, thereby enhancing the reliability and accountability of forensic investigations.
