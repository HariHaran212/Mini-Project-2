Evidence management plays a critical role in law enforcement, legal proceedings, and compliance-heavy industries, where ensuring the integrity, authenticity, and traceability of evidence is paramount. However, traditional evidence management systems face challenges such as tampering, loss of records, lack of transparency, and limited accountability. Blockchain technology offers a transformative solution by introducing a decentralized, immutable, and transparent ledger that enhances security and trust in evidence management processes. This paper explores the integration of blockchain technology into evidence management systems, outlining how blockchain's inherent features—such as cryptographic hashing, timestamping, and consensus mechanisms—ensure that digital evidence remains unaltered and verifiable throughout its lifecycle. The study further examines blockchain's potential to improve chain-of-custody tracking, streamline access control, and reduce the risks of human error. Through case studies and comparative analyses, the paper demonstrates the efficiency, cost-effectiveness, and reliability of blockchain-based evidence management systems, advocating for its adoption in legal, regulatory, and forensic environments.
