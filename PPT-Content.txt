Aim:
The aim of the Evidence Management System using Blockchain is to create a decentralized, secure, and transparent platform that ensures the integrity, traceability, and accountability of evidence handling throughout its lifecycle. By leveraging blockchain technology, this system aims to eliminate tampering risks, establish an immutable chain of custody, and provide an auditable record for legal and law enforcement purposes.
Objectives:
Ensure Evidence Integrity:
Use blockchain's immutable nature to store tamper-proof records of all evidence transactions, preventing unauthorized changes or alterations.

Enhance Transparency and Traceability:
Provide a complete and verifiable chain of custody for each piece of evidence, enabling stakeholders to track evidence from collection to court submission in real-time.

Improve Accountability:
Record every action performed on the evidence (e.g., transfers, access, modifications) with time stamps and authorized user identities, creating a transparent audit trail.

Automate Workflows with Smart Contracts:
Implement smart contracts to automate evidence-related workflows, such as approval processes, evidence transfers, and access control based on predefined rules.

Facilitate Role-Based Access Control:
Define and enforce access control policies to restrict evidence access to authorized personnel, reducing the risk of unauthorized handling.

Minimize Evidence Misplacement or Loss:
Ensure that every piece of evidence is logged and tracked securely, reducing the chance of misplacement or loss within the system.

Foster Trust and Public Confidence:
Promote public confidence in the legal and judicial system by ensuring that evidence handling is transparent, traceable, and secure, reducing risks of wrongful convictions or injustice.
